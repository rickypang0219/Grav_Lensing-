# Gravitational Lensing Cross-section
This program aims at calculating the lensing cross-section of source which lensed by haloes in the universe at different redshift. In this program, we use Halo mass function to find the comoving number density and its mass of haloes during differnt redshift $Z_{L}$. Then, we can plug these data to calculate the lensing cross section of gravutational waves source from high redshift region, denoted by $z_{S}$ 
The data of halo mass function can be downloaded at HMFcalc (http://hmf.icrar.org) 
The paper that discussed strong lensing: arXiv:2002.01479 ("
What does strong gravitational lensing? The mass and redshift distribution of high-magnification lenses")
